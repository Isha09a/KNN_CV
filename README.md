# KNN_CV
Building knn regression and Cross-validation  function.

In this repository, you will find a custom implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a widely used machine learning technique. Additionally, I have implimented a cross-validation framework to evaluate the algorithm's performance more rigorously.

The KNN algorithm  predicts data points based on their proximity to other data points. This project aims to provide a clear and simple example of KNN with CV ,building understanding of algorithm.
